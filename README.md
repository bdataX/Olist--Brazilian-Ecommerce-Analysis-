#  Project Overview  
[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

This repository contains the end-to-end analysis of the **Olist E-commerce dataset**, a Brazilian marketplace with **98,000+ orders (2016–2018)**.

The goal of this project was to deliver:

✔ A business-focused Power BI dashboard  
✔ Insights into customers, sales, products, and delivery performance  
✔ Clean and transformed datasets  
✔ A final written report & presentation  
✔ Python-based translation of Portuguese review text  

All modelling and analysis were done in **Power BI**, with **Python used for translating, sentiment analysis, customer aggregation, and keyword extraction**.

## 1️. Sales Analysis
Focus areas:
- Monthly & yearly revenue  
- Power BI forecasting  
- Payment behaviour trends  
- AOV (Average Order Value)  
- Customer retention + cohort analysis  

Deliverables:
- Forecast visualisations  
- Payment method analysis  
- Revenue cycle charts

Sales Analysis location: [analysis/sales.md](analysis/sales.md) 

---

## 2️. Product Analysis
Focus areas:
- Category performance and seasonal trends  
- Customer review scores by product category
- Freight vs weight/dimensions
- Delivery delays vs weight/dimensions


Deliverables:
- Category revenue & popularity charts

- **Roraima (RR)** had extreme delays (Average Delivery **92 days**)  
- Long delivery strongly correlates with low reviews  
- High-value orders take longer but reviews remain stable


---

## 4️. Customer Analysis
**Focus areas:**
- Portuguese → English translation (Python)
- Sentiment analysis  
- Topic extraction (negative reviews)  
- K-means customer clustering  
- Revenue-at-risk modelling 
- Regional satisfaction 
- Satisfaction trends  

**Deliverables:**
- Customer segments analysis pie chart
- Regional satisfaction analysis scatter chart

#  Review Translation (Python – VS Code)  
[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

Power BI cannot translate 50k+ text rows, handle API limits, or resume safely after failures.

Python enabled:
- Robust text cleaning  
- Deep-translator (Google backend)  
- Batch translation (500 rows)  
- Resume-safe workflow  
- Retry & rate-limit handling  

Script location: [translate_reviews.py](scripts/translate_reviews.py)
```python
# (Full script included in (scripts/translate_reviews.py)
# Translates Portuguese reviews to English with retry logic and batching.
```

##  Key Findings Summary  
[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### Sales Insights  
- Sales peak during holiday and seasonal periods.  
- Credit card is the most commonly used payment method.  
- Revenue displays clear cyclical and seasonal patterns.

---

### Product Insights  
- Watches & Gifts, and Computers dominate overall revenue.  
- Freight cost increase with product weight/volume but show more variability at higher weights/volume.
- Delivery delays are mostly unrelated to product characteristics.

---

### Delivery Insights  
- Delivery delays are the main cause of negative reviews.  
- Certain states (such as Roraima – RR) have extremely long delivery times.  
- High-value orders take longer to deliver but maintain higher satisfaction.

---

### Customer Insights  
- 22.27% of customers are at risk.  
- Negative reviews focus on defects, delays, and cancellations.  
- Satisfaction declined sharply in late 2018.

---

##  Recommendations  
[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### 1. High-Value Order Rapid Response Team  
Prioritise large, high-risk orders in slow-delivery regions.

### 2. Proactive Outreach to At-Risk Customers  
Prevent churn by recovering silent detractors early.

### 3. Improve Logistics in Chronic Delay Regions  
Focus particularly on captial city Boa Vista (Roraima State(RR)) and other outlier states.

### 4. Automated Quality Alerts for Product Issues  
Use negative sentiment spikes to detect emerging product defects early.
